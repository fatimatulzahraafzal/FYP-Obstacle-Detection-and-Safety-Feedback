# FYP-Obstacle-Detection-and-Safety-Feedback

There are three files in this repository. My project uses two devices NVIDIA Jetson Orin (edge server) and NVIDIA Jetson Nano (wearable edge device/client). The file orin.py is run on Jetson Orin, which waits for connection request from Jetson Nano. The two files walk.py and observe.py are run on Jetson Nano, depending on the mode that the user prefers.
